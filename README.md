Titanic Survival Prediction:
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It is based on the Kaggle "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" dataset — a popular beginner-level classification problem.

Project Overview
The main goal is to build a model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, number of family members aboard, and more.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python

Pandas and NumPy (Data processing)

Matplotlib and Seaborn (Data visualization)

Scikit-learn (Model building and evaluation)

Workflow
Data loading and exploration

Handling missing values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature encoding and transformation

Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation and prediction

Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Competition

Target variable: Survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Conclusion
This project helped me understand the end-to-end process of a machine learning workflow — including data cleaning, visualization, and classification. It was a great exercise to improve my skills in Python and predictive modeling using real-world data.
